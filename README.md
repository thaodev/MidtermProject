## Overview
  The website provides a variety of concerts, musical events for people. Any user can look up events, musicians, and bands, but in order to reserve tickets and/or remove tickets in their shopping cart, they are either the member of website or can sign up to become one if they haven't. Fans can leave reviews for any concerts they are interested in.
  Members also can create bands, which have multiple characteristics like genres, having musicians with their specialized musical instruments. The band managers also can create event with a lot of choices for given venues, for bands that they manage.
  Admin can do CRUD on all entities, users, tickets, events, reviews, etc... one of useful tools to manage the events that admin hold is seeing numbers of tickets sold for each events vs capacity of venues, in which events happen.
