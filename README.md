## Overview
  The website provides a variety of concerts and musical events for people. Any user can look up events, musicians, and bands, but in order to reserve tickets and/or remove tickets in their shopping cart, they have to be a member of the website, which they can do by simply signing up. Fans can leave reviews for any concerts they are interested in.
  Members also can create bands, which have multiple characteristics like genres and having musicians with their specialized musical instruments. The band managers can also create events with a lot of choices for given venues and bands that they manage.
  Admin can do CRUD on all entities, users, tickets, events, reviews, etc... One useful tool for managing events it that admin can see the number of tickets sold for an event vs the capacity of the venue in which the event happens.
